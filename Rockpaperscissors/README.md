# Rock Paper Scissors Game üéÆ

## Introduction

Rock Paper Scissors is a classic hand game where players choose between rock, paper, or scissors, with each option having a chance of winning or losing against the others. 

## How to Play

1. Start the game by running the main game script.
2. The game will prompt the player with the message:
   "What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors."
3. The player inputs their choice using the corresponding numbers (0, 1, or 2).
4. The game generates a random choice for the computer (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
5. The game compares the player's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner or if it's a draw.
6. The game provides feedback to the player, indicating whether they won, lost, or tied the round.

## Game Mechanics

- The user's input is stored as an integer (0, 1, or 2) representing Rock, Paper, or Scissors, respectively.
- The computer's choice is randomly generated using a random number generator.
- The game logic compares the player's and computer's choices to determine the outcome:
  - Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins against Scissors).
  - Scissors cut Paper (Scissors wins against Paper).
  - Paper covers Rock (Paper wins against Rock).
  - If both choices are the same, it's a draw.
- Feedback is provided to the player, indicating the winner or if it's a draw for each round.

## Getting Started
