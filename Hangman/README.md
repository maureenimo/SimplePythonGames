# For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
# Loop through each position in the chosen_word; If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
#e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].

# Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".

# Use a while loop to let the user guess again. The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word and 'display' has no more blanks ("_"). Then you can tell the user they've won.

# TODO-2: - If guess is not a letter in the chosen_word,Then reduce 'lives' by 1. If lives goes down to 0 then the game should stop and it should print "You lose."

# Join all the elements in the list and turn it into a String.
  # Check if user has got all letters.
# TODO-3: - If the user has entered a letter they've already guessed, print the letter and let them know.
