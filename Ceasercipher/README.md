# TODO-1: Create a function called 'encrypt' that takes the 'text' and 'shift' as inputs.

# TODO-2: Inside the 'encrypt' function, shift each letter of the 'text' forwards in the alphabet by the shift amount and print the encrypted text.  
    #e.g. 
    #plain_text = "hello"
    #shift = 5
    #cipher_text = "mjqqt"
    #print output: "The encoded text is mjqqt"

    ##🐛Bug alert: What happens if you try to encode the word 'civilization'?🐛

# TODO-3: Call the encrypt function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message.
