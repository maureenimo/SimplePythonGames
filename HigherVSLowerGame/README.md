# Higher vs Lower Game - Instagram Followers Edition

## Introduction

Higher vs Lower is a fun and addictive guessing game where players guess which Instagram account has more followers between two given accounts. 

## How to Play

1. Start the Higher vs Lower game by running the main game script.
2. The game will present two Instagram accounts to the player, along with their respective follower counts.
3. The player's objective is to guess which Instagram account has more followers.
4. The player enters their guess by selecting either "Higher" or "Lower" for the follower count of the second account compared to the first account.
5. If the player's guess is correct, they earn points and move on to the next round. If incorrect, they lose points or lives.
6. The game continues with new pairs of Instagram accounts until the player reaches a set number of rounds or runs out of lives.

## Game Mechanics

- The game fetches real-time follower counts from Instagram API for the presented accounts.
