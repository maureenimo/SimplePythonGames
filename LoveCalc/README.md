# Love Calculator

## Introduction

The Love Calculator is a program that tests the compatibility between two people by calculating a love score based on the occurrence of specific letters in their names. 

## How It Works

1. Input Names: Enter the names of the two people whose compatibility you want to test.
2. Calculate Love Score:
   - The program checks the number of times the letters in the word "TRUE" occur in both names.
   - It also checks the number of times the letters in the word "LOVE" occur in both names.
   - The program combines these numbers to create a 2-digit love score.
3. Output Messages:
   - For love scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message will be:
     "Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."
   - For love scores between 40 and 50, the message will be:
     "Your score is *y*, you are alright together."
   - Otherwise, the message will simply display their love score:
     "Your score is *z*."

## Example

```python
name1 = "Angela Yu"
name2 = "Jack Bauer"

# T occurs 0 times, R occurs 1 time, U occurs 2 times, E occurs 2 times (Total = 5)
# L occurs 1 time, O occurs 0 times, V occurs 0 times, E occurs 2 times (Total = 3)
# Love Score = 53

print("Your score is 53.")
```
