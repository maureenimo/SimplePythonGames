# Number Guessing Game

## Overview

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The game allows the player to submit guesses for a number between 1 and 100. It tracks the number of turns remaining and provides feedback on each guess. There are two difficulty levels: easy mode with 10 guesses and hard mode with 5 guesses.

## Features

- ASCII art logo at the start of the game.
- User input for guessing a number.
- Feedback on each guess ("Too high." or "Too low.").
- Display of the actual answer if the player guesses correctly.
- Tracking of the number of turns remaining.
- End-game feedback if the player runs out of turns.

## How to Play

1. Run the `number_guessing_game.py` file in a Python environment.
2. Choose a difficulty level: easy or hard.
3. Enter your guesses when prompted.
4. Receive feedback on each guess.
5. Keep guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of turns.
